  "description":"The Mount Keira Summit Park is a popular recreation and climbing destination within 90 minutes drive south of Sydney.\nThe mountain plateau features a well developed car park, picnic area, lookout with stunning views of the Illawarra coastline and a newly opened pop-up kiosk cafe. The plateau is ringed in by cliffs which are accessed by a mix of established foot tracks and bush scrambling.\nOf the four key cliff faces the West Face is the most popular and accessible, featuring many easier and shorter routes. The three other faces (South Face, North Face and East Face) are more exposed and progressively more difficult to reach, though do offer some excellent routes for those who pursue them.",
